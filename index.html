        <p>For this year I will be playing (if everything goes as planned) 14 tournaments, which my plan is to win 1 and be in the podium of others, also with this I would achive one of my major proyects, become a Top 20 national player in the Juvenile category.</p>
        
        <h2 id="school">School</h2>
        
        
        <p>This year I start 11th grade, precisely in August, but it's definetly an experience since it's my last year</p>
        
        <h2 id="career">Decide my career</h2>
        
        
        <p>I like Aviation, specially being a pilot, but im still in the process of trying to see which other career is not that much time consuming and brings me happyness and stability, I was thinking being a pro golfer, I just don't make my mind up.</p>
